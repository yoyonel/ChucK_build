KNOWN BUGS (miniAudicle-1.3.x (gidora))
----------------------------------------

- console output causes general performance degradation over time on OS X.  If
  you right-click the console monitor, an option to "Clear Buffer" will appear,
  which will speed things up again.  

- until chuck garbage collection is in place, MAUI windows don't self-destruct
  when associated shred is removed from the VM

- MAUI_elements not yet available from the command line chuck, which will 
  hopefully change in the near future

- MAUI elements not available in Win32/Linux

- auto-indentation still has a few problems on all platforms

If you have any bugs to report, please post a stack trace, the output of the
console monitor, the output of chuck --probe, and a description of the bug to
our email list: https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/mailman/listinfo/chuck-users
